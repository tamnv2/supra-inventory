# Owner Decision Ledger — SUPRA Inventory

Purpose: preserve Owner-approved requirements across chats without relying on manual end-of-session handovers. This file records durable Owner decisions and unresolved items. It contains no secrets.

## Authority and maintenance

- Latest explicit Owner command overrides older entries.
- When a newer Owner decision replaces an older one, mark the old entry `SUPERSEDED`; do not silently delete history.
- Implementation progress belongs in `ops/project-state.json` and `ops/resource-registry.json`; this ledger is for requirement/decision authority.
- Chat/project memory can help retrieve context but is not the canonical technical authority.

## Accepted decisions

| ID | Status | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| D001 | ACTIVE | Project is `SUPRA Inventory — Báo hàng` / `supra-inventory`, canonical repo `tamnv2/supra-inventory`. Do not mix with Pick Pack 1291, Pickface Damage, SupraCore, VHDCHY or other projects. |
| D002 | ACTIVE | Inventory scope is SKU + product name only. Do not manage bin/location/pickface position. |
| D003 | ACTIVE | Roles are `PICKER`, `REPORTER`, `ADMIN`, `ROOT`. Admin/Root inherit Reporter workflow capability; Root is highest application role. |
| D004 | ACTIVE | Picker identity is based on provisioned MNV/username. Client role is never trusted; service is authoritative for identity, role and state transitions. |
| D005 | ACTIVE | Unresolved duplicate rule is Picker + SKU. A retry/multiple press must not create another open report for the same Picker + SKU. |
| D006 | ACTIVE | Multiple Pickers reporting the same SKU are grouped into one processing batch, while each Picker retains a separate report ticket. |
| D007 | ACTIVE | Reporter queue priority: more currently affected Pickers first; if equal, earlier first report first. |
| D008 | ACTIVE | Picker can withdraw a mistaken report within 60 seconds only while unresolved. Deadline uses server time. |
| D009 | ACTIVE | Reporter resolution values are `HAS_STOCK` and `SKIP_ALLOWED`. `SKIP_ALLOWED` may be corrected to `HAS_STOCK` within 5 minutes; deadline uses server time. |
| D010 | ACTIVE | `report ticket`, `processing batch`, and lifecycle/audit `event` are separate semantics and records. Reporting must not merge them. |
| D011 | ACTIVE | Operational authority is Cloudflare Worker + `InventoryCore` SQLite. Google Sheets/Drive are source/archive/supporting systems, not a competing primary transaction store. |
| D012 | ACTIVE | Foreground realtime uses WebSocket; background delivery uses FCM. Reconnect must resync from authoritative server state; page reload is not synchronization logic. |
| D013 | ACTIVE | HR source is flexible. Admin/Root enters Google Sheet URL + exact tab name; backend validates readability, exact tab, MNV and Họ tên before saving. Do not hard-code one Sheet as product logic. |
| D014 | ACTIVE | Detailed operational retention target is about 60 days. Pending/unresolved survives retention until handled. Long-term archive/export is batched to Google Drive/Sheets; do not hot-write every event to Google. |
| D015 | ACTIVE | Beta and Stable are isolated runtime/data/credential environments. Stable never receives Beta runtime data by default. Stable remains Owner-gated until explicit release command and Owner acceptance. |
| D016 | ACTIVE | GitHub repo is Public for this project. Secrets/private keys/passwords/tokens/signing material must never be committed or exposed in repo/chat/logs. |
| D017 | ACTIVE | Finite jobs must continue automatically: trigger → poll → inspect logs → repair within scope → rerun → poll until PASS or a real Owner-only blocker/hard tool limit. Do not stop merely to ask Owner to send “tiếp tục”. |
| D018 | ACTIVE | Final network scope: Picker/Reporter use PDA on the PDA network with Internet. Admin/Root Website requires a network that can reach project services. Office network is unsupported because IT filters required runtime endpoints. Do not continue provider/fallback research unless Owner reopens the requirement. |
| D019 | ACTIVE | Stable may have source/config prepared, but no first deploy/provision, public traffic, real-user bootstrap, Stable refresh-token activation, Stable APK release, or promotion without explicit Owner command. |
| D020 | ACTIVE | Manual end-of-chat handover files are no longer the continuity mechanism. Repo-native project state + decision ledger + resource registry are canonical; `HANDOVER_CURRENT.md` is only a generated/readable view. |

## Superseded historical state

- Early handovers described the project as design-only or infra-only. Those status statements are `SUPERSEDED` by live repo evidence and `ops/project-state.json`.
- Older handover v3 stated Web/Android business implementation had not started and APK signing was pending. This is `SUPERSEDED` by later Beta app/auth/signing work.
- Handover v4 recorded schema v2 and Core Business APIs as the next build frontier. This is `SUPERSEDED`: live registry is schema v3 and the business API foundation is deployed.
- Earlier exploration of Office fallback providers is `CLOSED` by D018.

## Open decisions — do not invent

| ID | Status | Question |
|---|---|---|
| O001 | OPEN | SKU reset confirmation was described as random “6 chữ”; exact semantics (6 characters vs 6 words/other) are not yet Owner-confirmed. |
| O002 | OPEN | Final policy for one account using one vs multiple simultaneous devices/sessions. |
| O003 | OPEN | Final Root MFA/recovery design for Stable. |
| O004 | OPEN | Final reporting/export columns and exact Reporter dashboard visibility beyond the core queue. |
| O005 | OPEN | Final Stable password KDF/rate-limit/account-lock policy. |
| O006 | OPEN | Creation of a brand-new business report while fully offline is not approved. Do not add direct-to-Sheet or another offline primary path without an Owner decision. |

## Owner acceptance rule

Technical CI PASS does not equal Owner business acceptance. Owner may accept with numbered feedback such as `1 OK, 2 chưa OK...`; only explicit Owner acceptance should be recorded as accepted behavior for release/promotion decisions.
